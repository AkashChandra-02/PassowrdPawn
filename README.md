# PassowrdPawn
A password manager in HTML/JavaScript at the Code 211 hackathon, which was about 9 hours, the rest of debugging and testing.

This was by by a team of 4, 2 of which were beginners. This hasn't been used since February 26, 2018, so there may bugs. 

I'd like to thank wwwtyro for his Javascript encryption libary, which was the backbone of this project.
