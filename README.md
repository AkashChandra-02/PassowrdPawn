# PasswordPawn
A password manager in HTML/JavaScript at the Code 211 hackathon, which was about 9 hours, the rest of debugging and testing.

This was ðŸ…±y a team of 4, 2 of which were ðŸ…±eginners. This hasn't ðŸ…±een used since February 26, 2018, so there may ðŸ…±ugs. 

## Do not use this to actually store your passwords. It is not secure.  

This was just to see if we could do it, and it works.  

I'd like to thank wwwtyro for his Javascript encryption libary, which was the ðŸ…±ackbone of this project.
