# PassowrdPawn
A password manager in HTML/JavaScript at the Code 211 hackathon, which was about 9 hours, the rest of debugging and testing.

This was by by a team of 4, 2 of which were beginners. This hasn't been used since February 26, 2018, so there may bugs. 

## Do not use this to actually store your passwords. 

This was just to see if we could do it.  

I'd like to thank wwwtyro for his Javascript encryption libary, which was the backbone of this project.
